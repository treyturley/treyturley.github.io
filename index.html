                Here you will find a number of projects that I have been working on while learning web development.                
                I found it helpful to have some applications of my own where I could apply and practice the concepts covered in online courses and tutorials.    
                This resulted in some neat applications that I could share with my friends and family.    
                With sharing came feedback and a number of new features were added to expand what the applications could do.    
                The projects continue to evolve and the scorecards, especially for Skull King, have been a great addition to game night.
